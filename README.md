Data Analyst Portfolio
Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and actionable insights generation. My learning journey includes comprehensive training through Datacamp and extensive exploration of various open-source data resources and tools.

About This Portfolio
This portfolio serves as a practical demonstration of my capabilities in the data analysis lifecycle. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or extract valuable insights from raw data, including datasets that require significant cleaning and preprocessing. I believe in a hands-on approach, and these projects reflect my commitment to turning data into understandable and actionable information.

Skills Demonstrated
Through the projects in this repository, I demonstrate proficiency in:

Data Collection & Acquisition: Sourcing data from various open-source platforms.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, data type conversions, and inconsistent formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing main characteristics of data, often with visual methods.

Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical techniques to uncover trends and relationships.

Data Visualization: Creating compelling and informative charts and dashboards.

Reporting & Communication: Presenting findings clearly and concisely.

SQL Querying: (If applicable to any projects) Efficiently retrieving and manipulating data from databases.


Programming Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries:

Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib (for static visualizations)

Seaborn (for enhanced statistical visualizations)

Databases: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite - specify if used)

Visualization Tools: (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio - if used for dashboards)

To view the Jupyter Notebooks, you can clone this repository and open them in Jupyter Lab/Notebook, or simply view them directly on GitHub.
